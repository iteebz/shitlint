# ShitLint Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: The Trojan Horse (MVP)
**Goal:** Viral distribution via brutal roasting  
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

### Core Features:
- [x] AST-based architectural analysis
- [x] CLAUDE.md doctrine integration  
- [x] Brutal roasting feedback system
- [x] CLI tool (`shitlint analyze ./src`)
- [x] Basic file/directory scanning
- [x] Self-roasting (the ultimate test)
- [ ] LLM integration (users bring their own API keys)
- [ ] Configurable roasting severity

### Success Metrics:
- Developers share roasts on social media
- Word-of-mouth adoption in dev teams
- "This is actually useful" feedback

---

## Phase 2: The Memory Foundation (Competitive Moat)
**Goal:** Begin building architectural memory  
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks

### Core Features:
- [ ] Semantic memory integration (learns your patterns)
- [ ] Track analyzed files/patterns over time
- [ ] Basic deletion tracking ("you deleted this before, didn't you learn?")
- [ ] Simple pattern recognition
- [ ] Team-level memory (shared shame across team members)

### Success Metrics:
- Users notice repeated pattern warnings
- Teams start using for architectural decisions
- "It remembers my codebase" feedback

---

## Phase 3: Predictive Intelligence (The Moat)
**Goal:** Architectural predictions and recommendations  
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks

### Core Features:
- [ ] Predictive warnings ("this will become technical debt")
- [ ] Deletion recommendations ("remove these files")
- [ ] Architectural trend analysis
- [ ] Cross-project pattern detection
- [ ] CI/CD integration

### Success Metrics:
- Teams rely on ShitLint for architectural decisions
- Measurable reduction in technical debt
- Enterprise adoption interest

---

## Phase 4: Network Effects (Industry Scale)
**Goal:** Community-driven architectural wisdom  
**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks

### Core Features:
- [ ] Anonymous pattern sharing across teams
- [ ] Industry-wide architectural insights
- [ ] Crowdsourced roasting rules
- [ ] Architectural best practices database
- [ ] Plugin ecosystem

### Success Metrics:
- Network effects visible in user behavior
- Industry-wide architectural conversations
- Platform business model viable

## What We Start With (Next 2 Weeks)

### Immediate Priorities:
1. **CLI Tool** - `shitlint analyze ./src` works end-to-end
2. **Core Analysis** - Robust AST scanning with architectural patterns
3. **Roasting System** - Brutal but constructive feedback
4. **Memory Stub** - Basic file tracking (foundation for Phase 2)

### What We DON'T Build Yet:
- Complex agent reasoning (ceremony is the enemy)
- Advanced memory features (Phase 2)
- Network effects (Phase 4)
- Enterprise features (Phase 3)
- Paying for everyone's LLM calls (users bring keys)

### The MVP Test:
```bash
$ shitlint analyze ./my-project
ðŸ”¥ ARCHITECTURAL ROAST SESSION
Your codebase has 23 violations...
[brutal but helpful feedback]
```

**If developers share this output and ask for more, we've got product-market fit. If they cry, we've got product-market fit with feelings.**

## Strategic Principles

1. **Viral First:** Every feature must be shareable
2. **Memory Second:** Build the moat incrementally  
3. **Deletion Focus:** Always recommend removing, not adding
4. **Compound Value:** Each analysis should get smarter over time

The strategy is clear: **Start with the trojan horse, build the moat methodically.**
