⏺ CRITICAL EVALUATION: THIS IS BULLSHIT

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Critically evaluate suggested AIP components against existing ones 
       and portfolio needs

⏺ DUPLICATES: Timeline ✅, BlogPost ✅, CodeSnippet ✅ - already exist

  PORTFOLIO IRRELEVANT:
  - Testimonials - Who's giving testimonials for a personal portfolio?
  - Newsletter - Not a newsletter site
  - PricingTable - Not selling anything
  - FeatureComparison - Comparing what features?

  POTENTIALLY USEFUL BUT QUESTIONABLE:
  - Statistics - Already have this in testing/dev contexts, not interface
  component
  - ProgressiveDisclosure - We have expandable-section already

  ONLY MAYBE USEFUL:
  - None. Everything else is either duplicate or portfolio-irrelevant.

  EVALUATION: 7/10 suggestions are either duplicates or irrelevant to a
  personal portfolio/blog. This is exactly the kind of feature creep that
  violates the "Zero Line Philosophy" - adding ceremony without purpose.

  The existing AIP components + Folio extensions cover portfolio needs:
  markdown, key-insights, timeline, blog-post, code-snippet, project-card,
   skills-display. Adding enterprise SaaS components to a personal
  portfolio is peak bullshit.
