# ShitLint 💩🔍

**Your code is shit. Here's why.**

ShitLint is the AI code reviewer that cuts through the fluff and calls out the architectural dumpster fires hiding in your codebase. Because sometimes, brutal honesty is what is needed, even when it hurts.

## Why ShitLint Exists

Ever wonder why your "simple feature" took 3 weeks to implement? It's because your code is a tangled mess of:
- Copy-pasted functions everywhere (DRY? Never heard of it)
- 200+ line files of spaghetti bullshit
- Abstractions that abstract nothing
- Imports that look like some shat on your keyboard

Traditional linters catch typos. ShitLint catches **architectural bullshit**.

## What ShitLint Actually Does

```bash
$ shitlint .
```

```
⏺ FLAGGED BULLSHIT:

🚨 DRY VIOLATION:
- user_service.py:45-67 and admin_service.py:12-34 are literally the same function
- Did you copy-paste this? Be honest.

🚨 GIANT FILE ALERT:
- database.py:847 lines - This isn't a file, it's a novel
- Split this monstrosity before it gains sentience

🚨 BULLSHIT ABSTRACTION:
- utils.py:23 - A function called "doStuff" that does 47 different things
- Name your functions like a human, not a caffeinated squirrel

🚨 IMPORT CEREMONY:
- 23 imports for a 15-line file
- This isn't dependency injection, it's dependency addiction

VERDICT: Your code looks like it was written during a earthquake
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install shitlint
# or just clone this repo and suffer with the rest of us
```

## Usage

```bash
# Scan current directory
shitlint .

# Scan specific file
shitlint path/to/your/disaster.py

# Extra brutal mode (not recommended for sensitive developers)
shitlint --brutality brutal ./src

# Professional roasting (default)
shitlint --brutality professional ./src

# Gentle nudging (for beginners)
shitlint --brutality gentle ./src
```

## Configuration

Create a `.shitlint/config.json` file to customize how brutally honest you want the feedback:

```json
{
  "brutality": "brutal",
  "ignore_patterns": ["tests/", "*.generated.py"],
  "max_file_size": 100000,
  "llm_provider": "auto"
}
```

Or use the init command:
```bash
shitlint --init
```

## Language Support

- Python ✅ (your FastAPI spaghetti)
- JavaScript ⏳ (your React component soup - coming soon)
- TypeScript ⏳ (your over-engineered type gymnastics - coming soon)
- Go ⏳ (your "simple" microservice that imports 47 packages - coming soon)
- More languages coming (unfortunately)

## FAQ

**Q: Is this just a joke?**
A: No. Your code genuinely needs help.

**Q: Why so aggressive?**
A: Because your linter has been lying to you. Someone has to tell the truth.

**Q: Can I disable the roasting?**
A: You can, but then you're just running a regular linter. Where's the fun in that?

**Q: Will this hurt my feelings?**
A: Probably. But your code will be better for it.
